# Replicate Python client

This is a Python client for [Replicate](https://replicate.com). It lets you run models from your Python code or Jupyter notebook, and do various other things on Replicate.

## Breaking Changes in 1.0.0

The 1.0.0 release contains breaking changes:

- The `replicate.run()` method now returns `FileOutput`s instead of URL strings by default for models that output files. `FileOutput` implements an iterable interface similar to `httpx.Response`, making it easier to work with files efficiently.

To revert to the previous behavior, you can opt out of `FileOutput` by passing `use_file_output=False` to `replicate.run()`:

```python
output = replicate.run("acmecorp/acme-model", use_file_output=False)
```

In most cases, updating existing applications to call `output.url` should resolve any issues. But we recommend using the `FileOutput` objects directly as we have further improvements planned to this API and this approach is guaranteed to give the fastest results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Install

```sh
pip install replicate
```

## Authenticate

Before running any Python scripts that use the API, you need to set your Replicate API token in your environment.

Grab your token from [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account) and set it as an environment variable:

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your token>
```

We recommend not adding the token directly to your source code, because you don't want to put your credentials in source control. If anyone used your API key, their usage would be charged to your account.

<details>

<summary>Alternative authentication</summary>

As of [replicate 1.0.7](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python/releases/tag/1.0.7) and [cog 0.14.11](https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/tag/v0.14.11) it is possible to pass a `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` via the `context` as part of a prediction request.

The `Replicate()` constructor will now use this context when available. This grants cog models the ability to use the Replicate client libraries, scoped to a user on a per request basis.

</details>

## Run a model

Create a new Python file and add the following code, replacing the model identifier and input with your own:

```python
>>> import replicate
>>> outputs = replicate.run(
        "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
        input={"prompt": "astronaut riding a rocket like a horse"}
    )
[<replicate.helpers.FileOutput object at 0x107179b50>]
>>> for index, output in enumerate(outputs):
        with open(f"output_{index}.webp", "wb") as file:
            file.write(output.read())
```

`replicate.run` raises `ModelError` if the prediction fails.
You can access the exception's `prediction` property 
to get more information about the failure.

```python
import replicate
from replicate.exceptions import ModelError

try:
  output = replicate.run("stability-ai/stable-diffusion-3", { "prompt": "An astronaut riding a rainbow unicorn" })
except ModelError as e
  if "(some known issue)" in e.prediction.logs:
    pass

  print("Failed prediction: " + e.prediction.id)
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default the Replicate client will hold the connection open for up to 60 seconds while waiting
> for the prediction to complete. This is designed to optimize getting the model output back to the
> client as quickly as possible.
>
> The timeout can be configured by passing `wait=x` to `replicate.run()` where `x` is a timeout
> in seconds between 1 and 60. To disable the sync mode you can pass `wait=False`.

## AsyncIO support

You can also use the Replicate client asynchronously by prepending `async_` to the method name. 

Here's an example of how to run several predictions concurrently and wait for them all to complete:

```python
import asyncio
import replicate
 
# https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl
model_version = "stability-ai/sdxl:39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b"
prompts = [
    f"A chariot pulled by a team of {count} rainbow unicorns"
    for count in ["two", "four", "six", "eight"]
]

async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
    tasks = [
        tg.create_task(replicate.async_run(model_version, input={"prompt": prompt}))
        for prompt in prompts
    ]

results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
print(results)
```

To run a model that takes a file input you can pass either
a URL to a publicly accessible file on the Internet
or a handle to a file on your local device.

```python
>>> output = replicate.run(
        "andreasjansson/blip-2:f677695e5e89f8b236e52ecd1d3f01beb44c34606419bcc19345e046d8f786f9",
        input={ "image": open("path/to/mystery.jpg") }
    )

"an astronaut riding a horse"
```

## Run a model and stream its output

Replicateâ€™s API supports server-sent event streams (SSEs) for language models. 
Use the `stream` method to consume tokens as they're produced by the model.

```python
import replicate

for event in replicate.stream(
    "meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct",
    input={
        "prompt": "Please write a haiku about llamas.",
    },
):
    print(str(event), end="")
```

> [!TIP]
> Some models, like [meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct](https://replicate.com/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct), 
> don't require a version string. 
> You can always refer to the API documentation on the model page for specifics.

You can also stream the output of a prediction you create.
This is helpful when you want the ID of the prediction separate from its output.

```python
prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    model="meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct",
    input={"prompt": "Please write a haiku about llamas."},
    stream=True,
)

for event in prediction.stream():
    print(str(event), end="")
```

For more information, see
["Streaming output"](https://replicate.com/docs/streaming) in Replicate's docs.


## Run a model in the background

You can start a model and run it in the background using async mode:

```python
>>> model = replicate.models.get("kvfrans/clipdraw")
>>> version = model.versions.get("5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b")
>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    version=version,
    input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"})

>>> prediction
Prediction(...)

>>> prediction.status
'starting'

>>> dict(prediction)
{"id": "...", "status": "starting", ...}

>>> prediction.reload()
>>> prediction.status
'processing'

>>> print(prediction.logs)
iteration: 0, render:loss: -0.6171875
iteration: 10, render:loss: -0.92236328125
iteration: 20, render:loss: -1.197265625
iteration: 30, render:loss: -1.3994140625

>>> prediction.wait()

>>> prediction.status
'succeeded'

>>> prediction.output
<replicate.helpers.FileOutput object at 0x107179b50>

>>> with open("output.png", "wb") as file:
        file.write(prediction.output.read())
```

## Run a model in the background and get a webhook

You can run a model and get a webhook when it completes, instead of waiting for it to finish:

```python
model = replicate.models.get("ai-forever/kandinsky-2.2")
version = model.versions.get("ea1addaab376f4dc227f5368bbd8eff901820fd1cc14ed8cad63b29249e9d463")
prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    version=version,
    input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"},
    webhook="https://example.com/your-webhook",
    webhook_events_filter=["completed"]
)
```

For details on receiving webhooks, see [replicate.com/docs/webhooks](https://replicate.com/docs/webhooks).

## Compose models into a pipeline

You can run a model and feed the output into another model:

```python
laionide = replicate.models.get("afiaka87/laionide-v4").versions.get("b21cbe271e65c1718f2999b038c18b45e21e4fba961181fbfae9342fc53b9e05")
swinir = replicate.models.get("jingyunliang/swinir").versions.get("660d922d33153019e8c263a3bba265de882e7f4f70396546b6c9c8f9d47a021a")
image = laionide.predict(prompt="avocado armchair")
upscaled_image = swinir.predict(image=image)
```

## Get output from a running model

Run a model and get its output while it's running:

```python
iterator = replicate.run(
    "pixray/text2image:5c347a4bfa1d4523a58ae614c2194e15f2ae682b57e3797a5bb468920aa70ebf",
    input={"prompts": "san francisco sunset"}
)

for index, image in enumerate(iterator):
    with open(f"file_{index}.png", "wb") as file:
        file.write(image.read())
```

## Cancel a prediction

You can cancel a running prediction:

```python
>>> model = replicate.models.get("kvfrans/clipdraw")
>>> version = model.versions.get("5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b")
>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
        version=version,
        input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"}
    )

>>> prediction.status
'starting'

>>> prediction.cancel()

>>> prediction.reload()
>>> prediction.status
'canceled'
```

## List predictions

You can list all the predictions you've run:

```python
replicate.predictions.list()
# [<Prediction: 8b0ba5ab4d85>, <Prediction: 494900564e8c>]
```

Lists of predictions are paginated. You can get the next page of predictions by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method:

```python
page1 = replicate.predictions.list()

if page1.next:
    page2 = replicate.predictions.list(page1.next)
```

## Load output files

Output files are returned as `FileOutput` objects:

```python
import replicate
from PIL import Image # pip install pillow

output = replicate.run(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:27b93a2413e7f36cd83da926f3656280b2931564ff050bf9575f1fdf9bcd7478",
    input={"prompt": "wavy colorful abstract patterns, oceans"}
    )

# This has a .read() method that returns the binary data.
with open("my_output.png", "wb") as file:
  file.write(output[0].read())
  
# It also implements the iterator protocol to stream the data.
background = Image.open(output[0])
```

### FileOutput

Is a [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) object returned from the `replicate.run()` method that makes it easier to work with models that output files. It implements `Iterator` and `AsyncIterator` for reading the file data in chunks as well as `read()` and `aread()` to read the entire file into memory.

> [!NOTE]
> It is worth noting that at this time `read()` and `aread()` do not currently accept a `size` argument to read up to `size` bytes.

Lastly, the URL of the underlying data source is available on the `url` attribute though we recommend you use the object as an iterator or use its `read()` or `aread()` methods, as the `url` property may not always return HTTP URLs in future.

```python
print(output.url) #=> "data:image/png;base64,xyz123..." or "https://delivery.replicate.com/..."
```

To consume the file directly:

```python
with open('output.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(output.read())
```

Or for very large files they can be streamed:

```python
with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
    for chunk in output:
        file.write(chunk)
```

Each of these methods has an equivalent `asyncio` API.

```python
async with aiofiles.open(filename, 'w') as file:
    await file.write(await output.aread())

async with aiofiles.open(filename, 'w') as file:
    await for chunk in output:
        await file.write(chunk)
```

For streaming responses from common frameworks, all support taking `Iterator` types:

**Django**

```python
@condition(etag_func=None)
def stream_response(request):
    output = replicate.run("black-forest-labs/flux-schnell", input={...}, use_file_output =True)
    return HttpResponse(output, content_type='image/webp')
```
  
**FastAPI**

```python
@app.get("/")
async def main():
    output = replicate.run("black-forest-labs/flux-schnell", input={...}, use_file_output =True)
    return StreamingResponse(output)
```

**Flask**

```python
@app.route('/stream')
def streamed_response():
    output = replicate.run("black-forest-labs/flux-schnell", input={...}, use_file_output =True)
    return app.response_class(stream_with_context(output))
```

You can opt out of `FileOutput` by passing `use_file_output=False` to the `replicate.run()` method.

```python
const replicate = replicate.run("acmecorp/acme-model", use_file_output=False);
```

## List models

You can list the models you've created:

```python
replicate.models.list()
```

Lists of models are paginated. You can get the next page of models by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method, or you can use the `paginate` method to fetch pages automatically.

```python
# Automatic pagination using `paginate` (recommended)
from replicate.pagination import paginate

models = []
for page in paginate(replicate.models.list):
    models.extend(page)
    if len(models) > 100:
        break

# Manual pagination using `next` cursors
page = replicate.models.list()
while page:
    models.extend(page.results)
    if len(models) > 100:
          break
    page = replicate.models.list(page.next) if page.next else None
```

You can also find collections of featured models on Replicate:

```python
>>> collections = [collection for page in replicate.paginate(replicate.collections.list) for collection in page]
>>> collections[0].slug
"vision-models"
>>> collections[0].description
"Multimodal large language models with vision capabilities like object detection and optical character recognition (OCR)"

>>> replicate.collections.get("text-to-image").models
[<Model: stability-ai/sdxl>, ...]
```

## Create a model

You can create a model for a user or organization
with a given name, visibility, and hardware SKU:

```python
import replicate

model = replicate.models.create(
    owner="your-username",
    name="my-model",
    visibility="public",
    hardware="gpu-a40-large"
)
```

Here's how to list of all the available hardware for running models on Replicate:

```python
>>> [hw.sku for hw in replicate.hardware.list()]
['cpu', 'gpu-t4', 'gpu-a40-small', 'gpu-a40-large']
```

## Fine-tune a model

Use the [training API](https://replicate.com/docs/fine-tuning) to fine-tune models to make them better at a particular task.  To see what **language models** currently support fine-tuning,  check out Replicate's [collection of trainable language models](https://replicate.com/collections/trainable-language-models).

If you're looking to fine-tune **image models**, check out Replicate's [guide to fine-tuning image models](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/fine-tune-an-image-model).

Here's how to fine-tune a model on Replicate:

```python
training = replicate.trainings.create(
    model="stability-ai/sdxl",
    version="39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b",
    input={
      "input_images": "https://my-domain/training-images.zip",
      "token_string": "TOK",
      "caption_prefix": "a photo of TOK",
      "max_train_steps": 1000,
      "use_face_detection_instead": False
    },
    # You need to create a model on Replicate that will be the destination for the trained version.
    destination="your-username/model-name"
)
```

## Customize client behavior

The `replicate` package exports a default shared client. This client is initialized with an API token set by the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can create your own client instance to pass a different API token value, add custom headers to requests, or control the behavior of the underlying [HTTPX client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client):

```python
import os
from replicate.client import Client

replicate = Client(
    api_token=os.environ["SOME_OTHER_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"]
    headers={
        "User-Agent": "my-app/1.0"
    }
)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Never hardcode authentication credentials like API tokens into your code.
> Instead, pass them as environment variables when running your program.
